# CropSwap

This is the ui portion, WORK IN PROGRESS, revamp of my old capstone project. Users can add new and existing fields to current and past seasons and view crop history. Additionally, they can remove fields from a growing season.

This ui is the React Native front end for an Express.js program. This program intends to assist farmers with crop management.

Technologies Used: 
- React Native,
- tailwind.css,
- axios
